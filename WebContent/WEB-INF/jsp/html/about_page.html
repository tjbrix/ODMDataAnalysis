		<p>ODM Data Analysis is a tool for the automatic generation of generic descriptive statistics for each data 
		item contained in an ODM file. ODM Data Analysis is also available as Docker image to run the application on 
		a local PC. It can be obtained from <a  target="_blank" href="https://hub.docker.com/r/wwuimi/odmauswertung/" >Docker hub</a>.</p>
		<p> ODM Data Analysis is in active development. Thus, some bugs are already known and some features are already in development. 
		If you find a bug or would like to see a feature feel free to contact the authors. A list of known bugs and the changelog are provided 
		on the Docker page.</p> 
		<p>In the following, the 3 steps of the analysis workflow are explained as well as the user interface and the supported	
		statistics are described.</p>
		<!-- Step 1 -->
		<h4>Step 1: Upload an ODM file.</h4>
		<p>On the Home screen an ODM file can be selected and uploaded to the server. After pressing the upload button, the file
		upload to the server starts and afterwards the automatic analysis is triggered. A progress bar indicates the remaining time
		for the file upload and the analysis.</p>
		<p><b>Note:</b> Currently only ODM versions 1.3.0, 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 are supported. Other versions or invalid ODM files are 
		detected after the upload and a meaningful error message is provided to the user.</p>
		<p><font color="red"><b>Caution:</b></font> Please upload only ODM files, whose clinical data has been anonymized. Although
		the uploaded data will be deleted after the analysis process, we cannot provide the needed standards to process sensitive 
		personal information.</p>
		<!-- Step 2 -->
		<h4>Step 2: Viewing the results.</h4>
		<img src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/resources/pics/about/results.png" style="text-decoration:none;height:auto;max-width:100%">
		<p>After the analysis has finished without an error, the results are presented to the user in a new tab. The image above
		illustrates an example output:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The left-side navigation section corresponds to the <i>StudyEvents</i> contained in the ODM file. By clicking on each event, the list of associated 
			<i>Forms</i> are displayed in a drop-down menu.</li>
			<li>Each link corresponds to the <i>Forms</i> associated with the opened <i>StudyEvent</i>. By clicking on a <i>Form</i>, a table containing all <i>ItemGroups</i> 
			belonging to the selected <i>Form</i> appears on page. Additionally, table also contains the name of <i>Form</i> and <i>StudyEvent</i> to which it belongs.
			<li>This line shows how many times the selected <i>StudyEvent</i> appears in the clinical data and how many subjects have completed
			it. Due to <i>RepeatingKeys</i>, the data counts for <i>StudyEvents</i> can be larger than the number of subjects.</li>
			<li>This line shows how many times the selected <i>Form</i> appears in the clinical data and how many subjects have completed
			the it. Due to <i>RepeatingKeys</i>, the data counts for <i>Forms</i> can be larger than the number of subjects.</li>
			<li>These lines represent the <i>ItemGroups</i> of the selected <i>Form</i>. The number indicates how often at least one 
			item of the <i>ItemGroup</i> appears in the clinical data. Due to <i>RepeatingKeys</i>, the data count for <i>ItemGroup</i> appearances
			can be larger than the number of completed <i>Forms</i>. By defualt, all <i>ItemGroups</i> are minimized. Clicking on each <i>ItemGroup</i> 
			will open the associated <i>Items</i> below.</li>
			<li>These lines represent the <i>Items</i> of the <i>ItemGroup</i> above. Besides the data type of each <i>Item</i>, its 
			appearances in the clinical data and the generated descriptive statistics are shown. By clicking the 
			<img src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/resources/pics/charts.png" style="text-decoration:none;height:1.5em;width:auto"> icon,
			a chart is shown as to grant further information. Clicking the image again will minimize it.</li>
			<li>All <i>ItemGroups</i> can be collapsed or opened at once by clicking the sign here.</li>
			<li>The side navigation bar can be opened and closed using this button.</li>
			<li>Table for each <i>Form</i> can be closed using this button.</li>
		</ol>

		<p><b>Note:</b> <i>RepeatingKeys</i> cannot be handled in a general useful way during the generation of the statistics. Thus, they 
		are treated as new values each time. 10 subjects contributing a single time to an item will result in the same statistic as 
		if a single subject cointributes 10 times with the same values to an item. The user is warned for the presence of repeating 
		keys by the <i class="fa fa-key" aria-hidden="true"></i>
		icon. This icon can appear next to <i>ItemGroups</i>, <i>Forms</i> and <i>StudyEvents</i>.</p>

		<p>The following data types with the associated descriptive statistics are supported:</p>
		<p>
		<table style="width:100%">
			<tr>
				<th>ODM data types</th>
				<th>Provided chart</th>
				<th>Example statistic output</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>boolean</td>
				<td>Pie chart </td>
				<td>True: 55 - False: 45</td>
			 </tr>
			 <tr>
				<td>string, text</td>
				<td>No chart provided</td>
				<td>Different values: 22 - Top3: 1. car accident (22) | 2. outside influence (17) | 3. fall (5)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>integer, float, double</td>
				<td>Histogram over the range</td>
				<td>Min: 1.1 | Max: 8.8 | Mean: 4.95 | Median: 4.45 | StdDev: 2.694</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>time, date, datetime</td>
				<td>Histogram over the range</td>
				<td>Range: 10:10:10 on 05 May 1920 - 20:20:20 on 09 September 2010</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Code-/EnumeratedLists</td>
				<td>Bar chart of all items</td>
				<td>Different values: 3/3 - Top3: 1. Yes (50) | 2. No (30) | 3. Maybe (20)</td>
			</tr>
		</table></p>

		<h4>Step 3: Download the results as PDF.</h4>
		<p>The third tab provides the possibility to download the entire analysis and all charts combined in a single PDF. Each page of 
		the PDF corresponds to a single <i>Item</i> from the ODM file.</p>
